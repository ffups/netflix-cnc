Re-assessment brief: Netflix landing page clone
Overview
Recreate the Netflix landing page using a modern frontend framework (e.g. React or
Next.js). The focus is on identifying reusable design patterns, abstracting
components thoughtfully, and writing clean, maintainable code of high quality.
You will also discuss your choices and reflect on the project in two videos. There will
be one video for each course goal, read all details regarding the videos here.
Before you begin, carefully review the Learning Indicators.
Scope
To keep the scope manageable, you must include at minimum:
● At least one category/row of movies, for example: 'Popular'
● A hero section showing one featured movie/show
You’re welcome to add more rows, interactions, or features if you want, but keep the
focus on quality over quantity.
Technical requirements
● Use TMDb API to fetch real data
Note! Do not expose your API key – use environment variables and server-side
fetching if needed
● Component-based structure
Abstract recurring patterns (e.g., movie card, row) into reusable components
● Use linters and formatters (e.g., ESLint and Prettier)
Set these up to enforce consistency and readability in your codebase
● Follow best practices
Apply clear naming conventions, logical folder structure, and consistent
styling
● Version control
Push your code to a GitHub repo and keep your commit history clean
Pass with Distinction
To pass with distinction, you must demonstrate the ability to lead meaningful code
reviews by:
● Performing a self-led code review of your own project, using a structured
approach (e.g. checklist or review framework)
● Identifying areas for improvement in your own code — such as duplication,
lack of abstraction, or opportunities for testing
● Justifying potential improvements based on frontend best practices (e.g.
readability, scalability, maintainability)
● Reflecting on how you would provide feedback to a peer if this were their
project — showing your ability to review with clarity and empathy
This should be discussed in the video for course goal S12.
