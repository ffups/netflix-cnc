Provide real TMDb data: Register a v3 API key, add it to .env.local as TMDB_API_KEY, verify getHomePageData serves live categories, and confirm the .env file stays out of version control.


validate quality gates: Install dependencies and run npm run lint; address any warnings so you can mention lint cleanliness in the submission.


Publish source: Replace the placeholder Footer “View Source” link with the actual GitHub repo and ensure the commit history is tidy, since version control is part of the brief.


Prepare reassessment deliverables: Record the two required reflection videos (one per course goal), referencing your self-led code review as described in the brief.
